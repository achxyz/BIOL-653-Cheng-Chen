README
========================================================

Brief description of workflow.

I built a new file of R Markdown in File window.  In this file, I wrote several lines, and also embed some R code in it. After that, I rename the file 'README.rmd' and then saved it in my homework folder.

In addition, in this file, three R markdown formats show here:

First, you can make the content in **bold**;

Secondly, why the ## fontsize of the content does not work(TOT);

Finally, you can always insert a [link](http://jdunic.github.io/Intro-To-Practical-Computing-R/) here.

> I don't know what does quote mean.
