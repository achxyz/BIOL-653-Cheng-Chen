========================================================

This is an R Markdown document.

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of ny embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed e chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```

The embedded thing could be code again, like this:
```{r}
histgram(data01)
```
