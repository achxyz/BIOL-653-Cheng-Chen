README
========================================================

Brief description of workflow.

I built a new file of R Markdown in File window.  In this file, I wrote several lines, and also embed some R code in it. After that, I rename the file 'README.rmd' and then saved it in my homework folder.

In addition, in this file, three R markdown formats show here:

First, you can make the content in **bold**;

Secondly, you can change the ##font of the content;

Finally, you can always insert a [link](http://jdunic.github.io/Intro-To-Practical-Computing-R/) here.

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of ny embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed e chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```

The embedded thing could be code again, like this:
```{r}
histgram(data01)
```
